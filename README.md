## Installation <a name="i"></a>
The code should run with Python version 3 and the following python libraries:

- IPython
- statistics
- %matplotlib inline
- re
- category encoders
- seaborn


## Project Motivation <a name="pm"></a>
I analyzed StackOverflow data from 2011-2020 to analyze trends in coding languages and job satisfaction over time. My results answer the following questions:
1. Is there any correlation between the number of languages known and job satisfaction?
2. (maybe this?) Do individuals who know more languages tend to have higher job satisfaction?


## Project Files <a name="pf"></a>
There is one notebook cotaining the work showcasing the results of my analysis.

## Results <a name="r"></a>
Please view the results in my Medium blog post. 

## Acknowledgements <a name="a"></a>
All data was provided by the 2017 StackOverflow survey.
