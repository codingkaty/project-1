## Project Motivation <a name="pm"></a>
I analyzed StackOverflow data from 2011-2020 to analyze trends in coding languages and job satisfaction over time. My results answer the following questions:
1. What was the most popular language over the entire time period?
2. Which language had the highest increase in popularity?
3. Whichi language had the highest decrease in popularity?
4. Do individuals who know more languages tend to have higher job satisfaction?
