## Project Motivation <a name="pm"></a>
I analyzed StackOverflow 2017 survey data to dive into the following topics.
1. Does the number of langauges you know influence satisfaction in your career?
2. do people who prefer noise while working want coworkers to work quietly? 
3. What influences an individual to seek new job opportunities? 


## Project Files <a name="pf"></a>
There are three notebooks cotaining the work showcasing the results of my analysis. Each notebook is structured with markdown cells that explain the process. 


## Results <a name="r"></a>
Please view the results in my Medium blog post. 

## Acknowledgements <a name="a"></a>
